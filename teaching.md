## Error control in scientific modelling
**IS academia:** *to appear*\newline
**Semester:** *Autumn*\newline
**Target audience:** Mathematics Master, Materials science Master\newline

#### Summary
Errors are ubiquitous in computational science as neither models nor numerical
techniques are perfect. With respect to eigenvalue problems motivated from
materials science (transfer problems, atomistic modelling) we discuss,
implement and apply numerical techniques for estimating simulation error.

#### Content
* Types of simulation error
* Important eigenvalue problems in materials science
* Residual-error relationships for eigenvalue problems
* Perturbation theory
* Plane-wave basis sets and their discretisation error
* Parametrised eigenvalue problems
* Errors due to uncertain parameters: Perturbative and statistical approaches
* Non-linear eigenvalue problems (if time permits)

#### Prerequisites
* Analysis
* Linear algebra
* Exposure to numerical linear algebra
* Numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (such as finite-element methods, plane-wave methods)
* Exposure to implementing numerical algorithms (e.g. using Python or Julia)

This course delivers a mathematical viewpoint on materials modelling and it is explicitly intended for an interdisciplinary student audience. To keep it accessible, the key mathematical and physical concepts will both be revised as we go along. However, the learning curve will be steep and an interest to learn about the respective other discipline is required. The problem sheets and the projects require a substantial amount of work and feature both theoretical (proof-oriented) and applied (programming-based and simulation-based) components. While there is some freedom for students to select their respective focus, students are encouraged to team up across the disciplines for the course work.
