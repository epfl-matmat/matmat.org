## Error control in scientific modelling
**IS academia:** [MATH-500](https://staging-edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/error-control-in-scientific-modelling-MATH-500)\newline
**Semester:** *Autumn*\newline
**Target audience:** Mathematics Master, Materials science Master\newline

#### Summary
Errors are ubiquitous in computational science as neither models nor numerical
techniques are perfect. With respect to eigenvalue problems motivated from
materials science (transfer problems, atomistic modelling) we discuss,
implement and apply numerical techniques for estimating simulation error.

#### Content
* Types of simulation error
* Important eigenvalue problems in materials science
* Residual-error relationships for eigenvalue problems
* Perturbation theory
* Plane-wave basis sets and their discretisation error
* Parametrised eigenvalue problems
* Errors due to uncertain parameters: Perturbative and statistical approaches
* Non-linear eigenvalue problems (if time permits)

#### Prerequisites
* Analysis
* Linear algebra
* Exposure to numerical linear algebra
* Numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (such as finite-element methods, plane-wave methods)
* Exposure to implementing numerical algorithms (e.g. using Python or Julia)

This course delivers a mathematical viewpoint on materials modelling and it is
explicitly intended for an interdisciplinary student audience. To keep it
accessible, the key mathematical and physical concepts will both be revised as
we go along. However, the learning curve will be steep and an interest to learn
about the respective other discipline is required. The problem sheets and the
projects require a substantial amount of work and feature both theoretical
(proof-oriented) and applied (programming-based and simulation-based)
components. While there is some freedom for students to select their respective
focus, students are encouraged to team up across the disciplines for the course
work.

## Numerical analysis
**IS academia:** MATH-251(b)\newline
**Semester:** *Spring*\newline
**Target audience:** Materials science Bachelor\newline

#### Summary
The students will learn key numerical techniques for solving standard
mathematical problems in science and engineering. The underlying mathematical
theory and properties are discussed.

#### Content
The topics covered include:

* Linear and non-linear systems of equations
* Matrix factorisations and decompositions
* Numerical differentiation and integration
* Numerical solution of differential equations
* Regression and least squares problems
