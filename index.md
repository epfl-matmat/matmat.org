# Mathematics for materials modelling (MatMat)

Welcome to the website of the *Mathematics for materials modelling* research group.
We are a part of both
the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/)
and the
[Institute of Materials](https://sti.epfl.ch/imx/)
at EPFL.

[Our research](/research) sits at the interdisciplinary boundary between
mathematics, computer science and materials modelling.
If this suits you and you would like to work with us,
we encourage you to check out [our job openings](/jobs).
We also offer [student projects](/projects) at various levels.
