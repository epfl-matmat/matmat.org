# Mathematics for materials modelling (MatMat)

[![Group picture](/assets/2024.12.18_group.jpg)](/people)

Simulations are a crucial ingredient to develop new materials.
At the *Mathematics for materials modelling* research group
our mission is to **make practical modelling workflows more efficient
and reliable** by importing mathematical insights into practical
simulation schemes.
Here our focus is the development of **faster algorithms**
as well as a **rigorous understanding of simulation error**
across the modelling scales.

You can learn more about our work by taking a look at our
[**research topics**](/research),
our [**publications**](/publications),
our [**demo notebooks**](https://showcases.matmat.org/),
the [**software we develop**](/software).
If you are interested and you want to work with us,
feel free to take a look at our [**job openings**](/jobs).
We also offer [student projects](/student_projects) at various levels.
