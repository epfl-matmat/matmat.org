# Mathematics for materials modelling (MatMat)

Welcome to the website of the *Mathematics for materials modelling* research group.
We are a part of both
the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/)
and the
[Institute of Materials](https://sti.epfl.ch/imx/)
at EPFL.

We only got started recently at EPFL, so please bear with us
while this website mostly links to content from [Michael Herbst's website](https://michael-herbst.com).
