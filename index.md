# Mathematics for materials modelling (MatMat)

Welcome to the website of the *Mathematics for materials modelling* research group.
Our research centres on bringing insight from maths to materials modelling,
with the aim to understand simulation error and improve robustness of modelling schemes.
This is an interdisciplinary mission and we frequently collaborate with researchers
across the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science and materials.
At EPFL we are part of both
the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/)
and the [Institute of Materials](https://sti.epfl.ch/imx/).

You can learn more about our work by taking a look at
[our research topics](/research),
the [software we develop](/software)
or our [recent publications](/publications).
If you are interested and you want to work with us,
feel free to take a look at our [our job openings](/jobs).
We also offer [student projects](/student_projects) at various levels.
