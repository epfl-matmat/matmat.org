The typical fixed-point problem underlying DFT is solved iteratively using a variant of standard fixed-point iterations termed <em>self-consistent field &#40;SCF&#41; iterations</em>. In particular for challenging materials system the SCF can converge very slowly. Convergence acceleration techniques &#40;such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_acceleration">Anderson acceleration</a>&#41; are thus regularly employed and amount to speed up convergence. In a nutshell these methods build adapted linear combinations by solving a linear regression problem. However, typically the error in the regressed iterates &#40;i.e. the fact that these are polluted with numerical noise&#41; is completely ignored. In this project we want to develop a suitable adaptation of Anderson acceleration by combining this method with ideas from statistical learning in order to take numerical errors into account.</p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Strong programming skills, ideally Julia or python; Background in numerical methods, in particular for solving non-linear problems and eigenvalue problems; Interest or experience with statistical regression, in particular Bayesian methods; Experience in solid-state physics and materials modelling is a bonus;</p> <hr /> <h2 id=advanced_krylov_subspace_methods_for_materials_property_simulations ><a href="#advanced_krylov_subspace_methods_for_materials_property_simulations" class=header-anchor >Advanced Krylov subspace methods for materials property simulations</a></h2> <p>A central goal of modern materials modelling is to predict the chemical and physical properties of a material. Such properties colloquially describe how the material behaves under a change of external conditions such as a change of electromagnetic field, some external pressure. In the context of density-functional theory &#40;DFT&#41; simulations computing such properties requires the solution of a nested set of linear systems, that is one outer linear system, where each application of the linear operator itself requires solving hundreds of inner linear systems.

While this represents an additional approximation &#40;on top of the DFT model and the discretisation basis&#41;, this trick contributes considerably to making the numerics feasible in practice. Common pseudopotential models feature a multitude of parameters, which are determined following an involved fitting procedure. In practice the pseudopotential choice and the choice of DFT model are tightly coupled. However, since targeted pseudopotentials are not known for all DFT models, practitioners frequently perform DFT calculations with a mismatching pseudopotential.</p> <p>The goal of this project is to understand the discrepancy introduced by a mismatch between pseudopotential and DFT functional. This will involve both an analytical component, studying the variation under a change of pseudopotential using perturbation theory as well as a numerical component featuring systematic numerical experiments on standard DFT test problems.</p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Strong programming skills, ideally Julia or python; Basic knowledge of numerical methods for partial differential equations; Experience in numerical analysis of PDEs is a bonus; Experience in running DFT calculations is a bonus;</p> <hr /> <h2 id=data-driven_materials_modelling_with_uncertainty-informed_gaussian_processes ><a href="#data-driven_materials_modelling_with_uncertainty-informed_gaussian_processes" class=header-anchor >Data-driven materials modelling with uncertainty-informed Gaussian processes</a></h2> <p>Data-driven materials modeling plays a crucial role in modern materials discovery. Statistical models trained on large datasets of first-principles simulations provide efficient and accurate predictions of material properties, reducing the need for costly computations. However, datasets generated from density-functional theory &#40;DFT&#41; calculations, which underlie many data-driven approaches, face two key challenges:</p> <ul> <li><p>Non-uniform computational cost: The cost of DFT calculations varies significantly across materials due to differences in numerical parameters, such as discretization basis, k-point sampling, tolerances, required to achieve a target accuracy.</p> <li><p>Data heterogeneity: Training data often come from diverse sources with varying levels of uncertainty, which affects the reliability of predictive models. </p> </ul> <p>Active learning is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of data-driven materials modeling by adaptively selecting the most informative data points for further computations. Currently, a common approach is to compute the entire dataset with a fixed discretization &#40;e.g., plane-wave cutoff&#41; chosen a priori &#40;e.g. <sup id="fnref:vanderOord"><a href="#fndef:vanderOord" class=fnref >[6]</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:Merchant2023"><a href="#fndef:Merchant2023" class=fnref >[7]</a></sup>&#41;, which may not optimally balance computational cost and accuracy across diverse materials. </p> <p>The goal of this project is to investigate directions that overcome these challenges by integrating active learning with uncertainty-aware models. This involves formulating an active learning approach that adaptively selects both material structures and numerical parameters to optimize computational resources, while employing Gaussian process regression <sup id="fnref:RasmussenWilliams06"><a href="#fndef:RasmussenWilliams06" class=fnref >[8]</a></sup> to effectively propagate and manage uncertainties in heterogeneous datasets.
