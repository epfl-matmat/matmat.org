## Shapes: Patterns in Art and Sciences

[![Shapes psoster](/assets/2025.01_SHAPES_Poster.jpg)](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes)

From January 2025 until March 2025 Michael Herbst co-organises an exhibition
[**Shapes: Patterns in Art and Science**](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes)
at the EPFL Pavilions.

Our collection explores the richness of the natural and artificial patterns
that surround us. Bringing together art, mathematics, materials science and
biology, it highlights the shared fascination of scientists and artists with
geometric, dynamic and symmetrical structures.
The event is co-organised
in collaboration with two fellow mathematicians,
[Hugo Parlier](https://math.uni.lu/parlier/) and [Marc Troyanov](https://people.epfl.ch/marc.troyanov),
as well as help from colleagues in physics, biology and the EPFL Pavilion team.

For more information on the exhibition,
