## Shapes: Patterns in Art and Sciences

[![Shapes psoster](/assets/2025.01_SHAPES_Poster.jpg)](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes)

From January 2025 until March 2025 Michael Herbst co-organised an exhibition
[**Shapes: Patterns in Art and Science**](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes)
at the EPFL Pavilions.
In case you missed it there is a [[virtual tour]](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes)
available online (scroll to the bottom of the page).

Our collection explores the richness of the natural and artificial patterns
that surround us. Bringing together art, mathematics, materials science and
biology, it highlights the shared fascination of scientists and artists with
geometric, dynamic and symmetrical structures.
The event is co-organised
in collaboration with two fellow mathematicians,
[Hugo Parlier](https://math.uni.lu/parlier/) and [Marc Troyanov](https://people.epfl.ch/marc.troyanov),
as well as help from colleagues in physics, biology and the EPFL Pavilion team.

We also organised a **[scientific symposium](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/events/shapes-symposium)** with discussions between **scientists, artists and mathematicians**.
As part of the symposium Michael lead a **panel discussing**
the **interaction of art, scientific visualisation and science** as a whole.
The discussion has been recorded live and
can be [[watched using this youtube link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1bKNmgQz5w&t=17940s).


The exhibition has been **covered multiple times** by the **Swiss public radio channel RTS**:
