# Funding and collaborations

<!-- TODO Add info about my funding that I got -->
<!-- TODO add logos for each of these funding opportunities -->

## Participation in cross-departmental initiatives
- [**National competence centre in research MARVEL**](https://nccr-marvel.ch), *École Polytechnique Federale Lausanne (EPFL)*  
  Swiss national research centre on Computational Design and Discovery of Novel material
  including researchers in experimental and computational physics and chemistry
  as well as computer science. The goal is to bridge between communities
  and accelerate the state of the art of materials discovery.
  Our group joined the centre in May 2023 for the third funding phase
  in the pillar concerning
  [*Digital Infrastructure of Open Simulation and Data*](https://nccr-marvel.ch/people/projects/open-digital-infrastructure).
  Key aim is to integrate our [software efforts](/software/) surrounding
  [efficient black-box algorithms](/research/self_adapting_simulations/)
  with the high-throughput and pre-exascale platforms
  currently under development at MARVEL.

- [**Center for Exascale Simulation of Material Interfaces in Extreme Environments**](https://cesmix.mit.edu), *Massachusetts Institute of Technology.*  
  Research initiative advancing state-of-the-art first-principle simulations
  by connecting method development with (a) advances in programming languages,
  compiler technologies and performance engineering tools
  and (b) underpinning them with rigorous approaches to statistical inference
  and uncertainty quantification (UQ).
  With respect to the former aspect my main interaction is
  with the [JuliaLab](https://julia.mit.edu) of
  [Alan Edelman](https://math.mit.edu/~edelman)
  and on the latter I collaborate with
  [Youssef Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu)
  on [uncertainty quantification](/research/error_estimation/)
  in first-principles simulations.

- [**Extreme-scale Mathematically-based Computational Chemistry**](https://erc-emc2.eu/), *Sorbonne University, Inria Paris and École des Ponts ParisTech.*  
  Interdisciplinary initiative to advance the state of the art in first-principle
  simulations by integrating recent advances in numerical linear algebra
  (e.g. low-rank factorisations, randomised methods, GPU acceleration)
  and numerical analysis (e.g. *a posteriori* error estimation) into state-of-the-art
  molecular-dynamics and electronic-structure methods.
  Continuing from my PostDoc I participate in the development of
  [black-box density-functional theory methods](/research/self_adapting_simulations/) and
  [a posteriori error estimates](/research/error_estimation),
  mainly working with [Eric Cancès](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~cances/) and
  [Antoine Levitt](http://antoine.levitt.fr/).
