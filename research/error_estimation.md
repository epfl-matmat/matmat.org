# Estimation of simulation errors

Due to the involved multi-scale nature of standard materials simulation workflows
rigorous techniques for error estimates or uncertainty quantification (UQ)
are underdeveloped and error analysis on simulation results is rarely attempted.
However, recent activities to equip data-driven interatomic potentials
with built-in uncertainty measures as well as recent progress
on *a posteriori* error bounds for Kohn-Sham problems
(e.g. on predicted band structures[^HLC2020] or forces[^CDKL2022])
offer hope to achieve an error propagation all the way from the DFT level
to physical observables of long-running MD trajectories.

Band structure of silicon in a reduced (linear) Kohn-Sham model annotated with
guaranteed error bars, which indicate the total error (due to
discretisation/finite basis size, early stopping of iterative procedures as
well as finite floating-point arithmetic). Details in [^HLC2020].

## Algorithmic differentiation and ongoing efforts
Motivated by aforementioned prospect we currently investigate
both analytical as well as statistical error estimates for materials simulations
in [ongoing research collaborations](/research/funding/).
A key ingredient in this research is **algorithmic differentiation**,
i.e. the ability to compute arbitrary gradients.
Recently we integrated AD tools into our DFTK code (see [software](/software)),
making it (to the best of our knowledge) the first plane-wave DFT code,
where arbitrary user-desired gradients can be computed.

Our ongoing research investigates how this ability can be exploited
for sensitivity analysis,
uncertainty quantification or for analytical error estimations
with a first goal being to obtain a better **understanding of the
error of the DFT model** (pseudopotential, exchange-correlation functional)
in first-principle simulations.
