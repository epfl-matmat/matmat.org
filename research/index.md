# Research
Simulations are nowadays a crucial ingredient in the development of
new materials. Despite being nowadays routinely run in the millions,
the mathematical understanding of common materials simulations is still lacking.

With our work we want to accelerate computational materials discovery.
Key thrusts are working towards
[**efficient self-adapting simulations**](/research/self_adapting_simulations/)
and
[**mathematical understanding of simulation error**](/research/error_estimation/).
That is in particular methods for propagating error from first-principle data generation
to machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
and further to predictions of material properties.
Our research is supported by
[**international funding schemes and collaborations**](/research/funding/)
with researchers from multiple scientific disciplines.

For a **hands-on introductions** to our research topics
see our [**website of showcase Pluto notebooks**](https://showcases.matmat.org/).

On the first-principles side
our main focus is density-functional theory (DFT),
where most of our development takes place in the
[**Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK)**](https://dftk.org),
see also a general overview of [**our software**](/software).
On the MLIP side our interests are exploiting DFT error
in the context of  **active learning** or **adaptive numerical schemes**,
such that errors are balanced to obtain
a simulation result along a **path of least computational effort**.
