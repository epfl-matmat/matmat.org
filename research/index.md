# Research
The development and understanding of new materials play a key role for major
industrial and societal challenges of the 21st century.
Over the past years more and more materials have been design fully *in silico*.
At the core of this are automated workflows,
which systematically perform calculations on thousands to million of compounds.
Compared to the early years of materials modelling,
which was centred around performing
a small number of computations on hand-picked systems,
such high-throughput screening approaches have much stronger requirements
with respect to the robustness of employed algorithms:
even a small percentage of erroneous or failing calculations equals
a large number of cases, which need to be checked by a human (causing idle time)
and redone thereafter (causing a noteworthy computational overhead).

Research in the MatMat group centres around overcoming these obstacles
and **accelerating computational materials discovery** by providing
[**efficient self-adapting simulations**](/research/self_adapting_simulations/)
featuring a
[**control of simulation error**](/research/error_estimation/).
Achieving these aspects not only contributes crucially to reducing
the human time required to setup and verify calculations
(the typical bottleneck in high-throughput workflows),
but it also enables promising prospects
such as **active learning** or **adaptive numerical schemes**,
which automatically balance errors in order to
obtain a simulation result along a **path of least computational effort**.
Our main application are first-principle methods based
on density-functional theory (DFT),
but we furthermore work on a range of other problems,
such as the **modelling of** [**quantum spin systems**](/research/spin_systems)
using tensor methods.

This work is inherently a multidisciplinary research effort
such that we participate in a number of
[**cross-disciplinary research initiatives**](/research/funding/)
and collaborations.
A central component of our research efforts is therefore
additionally to [**develop interdisciplinary software platforms**](/software/)
which allow all involved communities to synergically join their forces.
Building on top of these codes we explore emerging opportunities
such as [**mixed-precision linear algebra**](/research/self_adapting_simulations/)
or [**algorithmic differentiaton**](/research/error_estimation/)
for materials modelling and investigate their perspectives to obtain
more efficient simulations or to better integrate physical models
with data-driven approaches.
