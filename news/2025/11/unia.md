Michael has been invited to the **University of Augsburg**
in Bavaria, Germany to give a talk in the seminar
of the group of Daniel Petersheim.
His talk is titled
[*Kohn-Sham Density-Functional Theory: Perspectives on various inverse problems*](https://michael-herbst.com/talks/2025.11.03_Augsburg_ForwardInverse_DFT.pdf)
and he talk about inverse problems in Kohn-Sham DFT,
such as learning the exchange-correlation potential,
or the Kohn-Sham potential
knowing only physical observables such as the optimised structure
or the electron density.
