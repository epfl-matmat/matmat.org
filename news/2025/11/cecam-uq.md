**25.11 - 28.11.2025** Jointly with 
Sanggyu Chong (EPFL), Genevieve Dusson (CNRS),
Federico Grasselli (Modena) and
Julia Westermayr (Leipzig)
we  will organise a **CECAM / Psi-k workshop**
[**Uncertainty quantification in atomistic modelling**](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1380)
in **Lausanne, Switzerland**.
In the workshop we want to
bridge various topics and directions on how to quantify and propagate
uncertainties from DFT through ML towards predicted properties.

During the conference **Niklas Schmitz** will give a **tutorial** on
[*Uncertainty quantification methods for density-functional theory*](https://github.com/niklasschmitz/tutorial-cecam-workshop-dftk-2025)
based on our [recent preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07785).
