**06.10.2025 - 10.10.2025** Michael has been invited to the workshop [Bridging Scales from Atomistic to Continuum in Electrochemical Systems](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-ii-bridging-scales-from-atomistic-to-continuum-in-electrochemical-systems/) at the [**Institute of pure and applied mathematics (IPAM)**](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, Los Angeles, California. At the workshop he will give a talk about [*Algorithmic differentiation in plane-wave DFT*](https://michael-herbst.com/talks/2025.10.09_IPAM_DFT_Gradients.pdf) including a few hands-on examples.
A recording is available [on youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=g6j1beYSWV4).
