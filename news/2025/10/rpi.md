**15.10.2025**
Michael has been invited to **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)**
in Troy, New York to give a talk in the
[Mathematical Sciences Seminar Series](https://math.rpi.edu/events/kohn-sham-density-functional-theory-perspectives-various-inverse-problems).
In his talk titled
*Kohn-Sham Density-Functional Theory: Perspectives on various inverse problems*
Michael will talk about inverse problems in Kohn-Sham DFT,
such as learning the exchange-correlation potential,
or the Kohn-Sham potential
knowing only physical observables such as the optimised structure
or the electron density.
