**17.01 - 09.03.2025** For a good month and a half in early 2025

[**Shapes: Patterns in Art and Science**](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes).

Inspired by the works of the painter M. C. Escher
this exhibition explores the richness of the natural and artificial patterns
that surround us. Bringing together art, mathematics, materials science and
biology, it highlights the shared fascination of scientists and artists with
geometric, dynamic and symmetrical structures. 

This exhibition Michael co-organises
in collaboration with two fellow mathematicians,
[Hugo Parlier](https://math.uni.lu/parlier/) and [Marc Troyanov](https://people.epfl.ch/marc.troyanov),
as well as help from colleagues in physics, biology and the EPFL Pavilion team.
