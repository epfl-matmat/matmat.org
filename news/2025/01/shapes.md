**17.01 - 09.03.2025** For a good month and a half in early 2025
the [EPFL Pavilions](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/) will host the exhibition
**Shapes: Patterns in Art and Science**. This **outreach event** we co-organise
in collaboration with two fellow mathematicians,
[Hugo Parlier](https://math.uni.lu/parlier/) and [Marc Troyanov](https://people.epfl.ch/marc.troyanov),
as well as help from colleagues in physics and the EPFL Pavilion team.
Inspired by the works of the painter M. C. Escher we will explore
the relationship between patterns arising in mathematics and various
scientific fields such as biology and crystallography as well as contemporary art.

An accompanying program of a kick-off symposium and guided tours will be organised.
All is open to the general public. Everyone is very much encouraged to attend.
