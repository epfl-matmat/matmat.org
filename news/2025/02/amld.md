**13.02.2025** Jointly with Michele Ceriotti (EPFL) we will organise
a track **Quantifying Uncertainties in multiphysics learning** at EPFL's
[Applied Machine Learning Days 2025](https://2025.appliedmldays.org).
In a line-up featuring [Jigyasa Nigam](https://curiosity54.github.io/),
[Thomas Swinburne](https://tomswinburne.github.io/)
and [Phaedon-Stelios Koutsourelakis](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/koutsourelakis-phaedon-stelios/)
we will discuss the challenges of learning across different physical scales
and some ideas how errors can be quantified along the way.
