**12.02.2025**
Today the [scientific symposium](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/events/shapes-symposium)
accompanying our exhibition **Shapes: Patterns in Art and Science** took place.
In three panels we discussed questions such as the mediation and communication
of mathematics and science by the means of art.

As part of the symposium Michael lead a **panel discussing**
the **interaction of art, scientific visualisation and science** as a whole.
The discussion has been broadcasted live on youtube
and can be [[watched using this youtube link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1bKNmgQz5w&t=17940s).

For **more details on the exhibition**, still running until 9th March,
take a look at [our website](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/exhibitions/shapes)
and [this earlier article](/news/2025/01/shapes/).
