**28.05.2025: New publication**
Today our paper [Kohn-Sham inversion with mathematical guarantees](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.111.205143) has been published in Physical Review B.
This article is the outcome of a fun collaboration with the group of
Andre Laestadius from Oslo Mettropolitan University (OsloMet),
which came to life during a 2-week research stay in [Oberwolfach](https://mfo.de).
