**09.03 - 14.03.2025** Jointly with Geneviève Dusson (Besançon) and Benjamin Stamm (Stuttgart)
we will organise a workshop at the [Mathematical Research Institute Oberwolfach](https://mfho.de)
on [**Mathematical Methods in Quantum Chemistry**](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2511/) bringing
together the community of mathematicians interested on problems in quantum chemistry and
electronic structure theory as well as some application researchers interested in the
mathematical aspects of these models.
