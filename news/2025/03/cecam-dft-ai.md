**03.03 - 06.03.2024** Our group participates in the CECAM workshop
[**Density Functional Theory and Artificial Intelligence learning from each other**](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1281) at EPFL.
At the workshop Niklas will present a poster
about his recent work on exploring algorithmic differentiation
for density-functional theory
and Michael will give a related **invited talk** titled
[*Algorithmic differentiation in plane-wave DFT*](https://michael-herbst.com/talks/2025.03.04_DFT_AI_Learning_each_other.pdf).
