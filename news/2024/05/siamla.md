**13.05.2024 - 17.05.2024**
Jointly with Eric Canc√®s and Antoine Levitt
Michael co-organises a
[minitutorial *Linear Algebra Challenges in Electronic Structure Simulations*]
(https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=79649)
at SIAM Linear Algebra (**SIAM LA**) in Paris, France.

Later in the week Michael will also speak about
[*An Adaptive Line Search for Self-Consistent Field Problems of Electronic Structure Theory*](https://michael-herbst.com/talks/2024.05.15_siamla_adaptive.pdf)
in the minisymposium [*Eigenvector-Dependent Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems and Applications*](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=78744).
