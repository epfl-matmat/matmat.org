**29.08.2024 - 30.08.2024** As part of our group's involvement in the
[Modelling, Analysis and Simulation of Molecular Systems](https://moansi.wixsite.com/gamm)
interest group, Michael co-organises a workshop
on [Uncertainty Quantification in Molecular Simulation](https://indico3.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/event/40/)
(jointly with Feliks NÃ¼ske).
The workshop will be a lunch-to-lunch event tailored to people, who are familiar with the modelling
of molecular simulations, but not yet familiar with UQ and error estimation.
