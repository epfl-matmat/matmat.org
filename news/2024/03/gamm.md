The MatMat group attends the [94th annual meeting](https://jahrestagung.gamm.org/annual-meeting-2024/94th-annual-meeting/)
of the German Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (**GAMM**)
in Magdeburg, Germany.
This year Michael co-organises the section
*Modelling, analysis and simulation of molecular systems*
(with Sebastian Matera).
Due to many strong submissions there are **over 12 hours of talks**
about electronic structures and atomistic modelling taking place at GAMM !
