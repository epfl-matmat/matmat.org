**26.11.2024 - 28.11.2024** Jointly with Antoine Levitt (University of Paris Orsay) and
Jutho Haegeman (University of Ghent) we will organise a **Psi-k workshop** at the intersection
of quantum physics, computer science and numerical linear algebra / optimisation.
The main motivation is to explore current problems in the field and
the opportunities of the Julia programming language for
researchers from aforementioned communities to join forces.
The workshop is titled
[**Julia for numerical problems in quantum and solid-state physics**](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1355)
and will take place at the [CECAM HQ](https://www.cecam.org/) in **Lausanne, Switzerland**.

The workshop turned out to be a full success with about 60 Julia-interested researchers
coming together in Lausanne:
