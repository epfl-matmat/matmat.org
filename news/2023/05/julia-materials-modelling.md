**24.05.2023** Our group hosts a seminar
[Julia for Materials Modelling](https://memento.epfl.ch/event/julia-for-materials-modelling-2/).
In the form of interactive Pluto notebooks Michael discusses
the suitability of Julia for atomistic materials modelling
and provides an overview of the current state of Julia tools in this field.
