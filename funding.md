# Funding and collaborations

## Individual funding
- [**Practical discretisation error estimates for data-driven materials modelling**](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/10002757) (Swiss National Science Foundation, Oct 2025 -- Sept 2029, 600k CHF)
  Modern computational materials discovery frequently involves machine-learned
  surrogates trained by running density-functional theory (DFT) simulations on a
  large set of structures. The error in the training data itself is predominantly
  modelled as small, homoscedastic Gaussian noise, such that the simulated DFT
  quantities need to be of consistently good quality across the entire data set.
  Recent mathematical advances offer a quantitative approach to model the error
  due to the chosen plane-wave cutoff in energy and forces. In this project we
  will (1) to develop these discretisation error estimates into a routine tool
  for materials modelling and (2) to employ such quantitative estimates to
  overcome the limitations of a homoscedastic error model
  within Gaussian Processes (GP) regression.

- [**A novel approach to first-principles inverse materials design leveraging algorithmic property derivatives**](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/221186) (Swiss National Science Foundation, Apr 2024 -- Mar 2026, 100k CHF)

## Participation in centres and cross-institutional initiatives
- [**National competence centre in research MARVEL**](https://nccr-marvel.ch), *École Polytechnique Federale Lausanne (EPFL)* (2023 -- 2026) \newline
  Swiss national research centre on Computational Design and Discovery of Novel material
  including researchers in experimental and computational physics and chemistry
  as well as computer science. The goal is to bridge between communities
  and accelerate the state of the art of materials discovery.
  Our group joined the centre in May 2023 for the third funding phase
  in the pillar concerning
  [*Digital Infrastructure of Open Simulation and Data*](https://nccr-marvel.ch/people/projects/open-digital-infrastructure).
  Key aim is to integrate our [software efforts](/software/) surrounding
  [efficient black-box algorithms](/research/self_adapting_simulations/)
  with the high-throughput and pre-exascale platforms
  currently under development at MARVEL.

- [**Center for Exascale Simulation of Material Interfaces in Extreme Environments**](https://cesmix.mit.edu), *Massachusetts Institute of Technology.* (2022 -- 2025 \newline
  Research initiative advancing state-of-the-art first-principle simulations
  by connecting method development with (a) advances in programming languages,
  compiler technologies and performance engineering tools
  and (b) underpinning them with rigorous approaches to statistical inference
  and uncertainty quantification (UQ).
  With respect to the former aspect my main interaction is
  with the [JuliaLab](https://julia.mit.edu) of
  [Alan Edelman](https://math.mit.edu/~edelman)
  and on the latter I collaborate with
  [Youssef Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu)
  on [uncertainty quantification](/research/error_estimation/)
  in first-principles simulations.

- [**Extreme-scale Mathematically-based Computational Chemistry**](https://erc-emc2.eu/), *Sorbonne University, Inria Paris and École des Ponts ParisTech.* (2019 -- 2024) \newline
  Interdisciplinary initiative to advance the state of the art in first-principle
  simulations by integrating recent advances in numerical linear algebra
  (e.g. low-rank factorisations, randomised methods, GPU acceleration)
  and numerical analysis (e.g. *a posteriori* error estimation) into state-of-the-art
  molecular-dynamics and electronic-structure methods.
  Continuing from my PostDoc I participate in the development of
  [black-box density-functional theory methods](/research/self_adapting_simulations/) and
  [a posteriori error estimates](/research/error_estimation),
  mainly working with [Eric Cancès](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~cances/) and
  [Antoine Levitt](http://antoine.levitt.fr/).
