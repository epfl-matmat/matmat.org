% Some mandatory keys (apart from the obvious):
%  - `url`: Use to provide a link to accessing the paper in open-access form
%           (e.g. arxiv, link to pdf on preprint server etc.).
%  - `year` `month` and `day` are used for ordering the entries
%  - `note`: Needs to be non-empty for unpublished items for reasons
%            of technical limitations
% Optional keys:
%  - `code`: Use to provide link to github repo or similar containing reproducer
%  - `data`: Use to provide link where data required for the study is available
