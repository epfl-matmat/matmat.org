## PhD position: Error-controlled Bayesian methods for inverse materials design

#### Background
In inverse materials design one wishes to discover novel materials
in a targeting fashion. That is guided by systematic simulations of
the expected properties of candidate structures, one aims to find the
structure best matching a prescribed targeted property combination.
A common approach is to employ a statistical surrogate (e.g. within a Bayesian
Optimisation framework) such that the search only requires as few as possible
of the expensive first-principle simulations.
We will focus on approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) simulation
-- an extremely common electronic-structure model.

#### Project goals
Recent advances in the direction of multi-fidelity statistical models [^2]
as well as techniques to estimate numerical errors [^3] in DFT simulations
provide new opportunities for efficient, error-controlled
Bayesian optimisation schemes for inverse materials design.
In collaboration with similar ongoing projects in the group
we will explore how these opportunities enable to accelerate
the discovery of materials for electronics and mechanical devices.

#### Candidate profile
* You are highly motivated and want to become an independent researcher in a fascinating
  interdisciplinary field, working towards faster and more reliable methods
  for discovering the materials of tomorrow.
* You have a strong sense of autonomy and independence, but also enjoy being part of a diverse team.
* You have completed a Master (or 4-year Bachelor) in physics, mathematics or a related subject.
  Candidates who will complete their degree within the next months are also welcome to apply.
* Your academic record is strong and underpins your potential to become an excellent researcher.
* The ideal candidate has a prior background in multiple of the following subject areas:
  Bayesian optimisation, Gaussian Process Regression,
  inverse design for PDEs in engineering or physics,
  mathematical structure of quantum physics, condensed matter physics,
  atomistic modelling, atomistic machine learning, electronic structure theory.
* While you may not have expertise in all of these domains you look forward
  to acquiring expertise in electronic structure theory and atomistic modelling.
* You have a strong interest in numerical methods, their implementation and application
  to physics and materials simulations.
<!--
* You enjoy programming and implementing algorithms and have solid experience
  in an HPC programming language such as C++, Fortran or Julia.
-->
* You are fluent in written and oral English.
* Bonus skills for this application are considerable experience in
  sustainable software engineering or high-performance computing.

#### What is offered
The activities of the MatMat group revolve around understanding
modern materials simulations from a mathematical point of view
-- and to come up with ways to make such simulations faster and quantify their errors.
You will become part of a young and energetic team,
fully integrated with both the [mathematics](https://math.epfl.ch/)
and the [materials](https://imx.epfl.ch/) institutes
as well as multiple cross-disciplinary initiatives,
such as the [NCCR MARVEL](https://nccr-marvel.ch/).
Within the proposed topic you will be able to bring in your prior expertise,
but also be able to get to know the exciting theory and practice of material modelling.
EPFL's main campus is beautifully located at the lake Geneva shore
hosting a stimulating community of interdisciplinary-minded researchers.
Funds to disseminate your work at suitable conferences
as well as potential visits to our international network of collaboration partners
are provided.

and [PhD admission criteria](https://www.epfl.ch/education/admission/admission-2/phd-admission-criteria-and-application/).

#### Deadline and starting date
The position is available from autumn 2025 and hiring will be done on a continuous basis
until a suitable candidate has been found.
Note, that the chosen candidate will have to be accepted into
one of the aforementioned doctoral schools
before the contract can start.
