We work on understanding the mathematical properties of materials simulations, developing new physical models, techniques for understanding simulation error, reliable algorithms as well as modern software design and implementation strategies for simulation codes.</p> <p>For this work ideal candidates should have a solid knowledge of linear algebra and numerics, experience in programming and scientific computing as well as the application of these methods to chemistry, materials science and physics. But what is most important is that the applicant demonstrates broad interests as well as a curiosity to learn from the disciplines they might not be familiar with. On top of that we seek a good portion of critical thinking and creativity to come up with the unusual solutions we often require. At the PhD level we are open to candidates from many backgrounds and study programmes while at the PostDoc level we often seek applicants whose expertise is more focused and topic-specific.</p> <p>Before you apply please take your time to familiarise yourself with the <a href="/research">ongoing research</a> in our group. If you apply to one of the <a href="/jobs">specific job openings</a>, please also read the project-specific information carefully. In your application we encourage you to make reference to the research programme of our group and discuss how your background and interests fit in.</p> <p>Your application should contain:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Cover letter</strong> &#40;max 1 page&#41;: Explain here why you would like to work with us and how your profile fits our research programme.</p> <li><p><strong>full CV</strong>: Make sure to include a publication list <em>&#40;if you have prior publications&#41;</em></p> <li><p>Full transcript of marks <em>&#40;for PhD applicants&#41;</em></p> <li><p>Contact information for <strong>three references</strong></p> </ul> <p>Please send your files to <a href="mailto:michael.herbst@epfl.ch?subject&#61;&#91;APPLICATION&#93;">this email address</a>, making sure to include the text <code>&#91;APPLICATION&#93;</code> at the start of the subject. We may silently ignore your application if you do not comply with these instructions.</p> <p>A note for <strong>PhD applicants</strong>: Before you can start in our group you need to get <em>additionally</em> admitted into an EPFL doctoral school. In our group both the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edma-mathematics/">doctoral school in mathematics &#40;EDMA&#41;</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edmx-materials-science-and-engineering/">doctoral school in materials &#40;EDMX&#41;</a> are suitable. You can use these links to find further information about the schools and their respective application process &#40;including the respective deadlines&#41;.</p> <p>We strongly recommend you to apply to one of these doctoral schools in parallel, since the required information is very similar &#40;so you only need to collect it once&#41;. Moreover admission to a doctoral school gives you a chance to obtain a PhD position in other groups at EPFL as well. If your desired project topic is more closely related to numerics / analysis, you should probably apply to EDMA, whereas if the project will be more on the side of physical models / materials applications, you should apply to EDMX.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="https://github.com/epfl-matmat/matmat.org/"><b>Edit this page on <img class=logo  src="/assets/icons/github.png"></b></a><br> Last modified: October 24, 2025.
